              one in the area, but the light shining in his eyes proved him
              wrong. It came from about 100 feet away and was shining so
              directly into his eyes he couldn't make out anything about the
              person holding the light. There was only one thing to do in this
              situation. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a flashlight
              of his own that was much stronger than the one currently blinding
              him. He turned it on and pointed it into the stranger's eyes.
